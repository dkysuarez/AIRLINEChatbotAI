How do I check my baggage if I have checked in for the flight online?
If you have checked in for your flight online and need to check your baggage, follow these steps for a seamless process:
Checked baggage guidelines
First, review our baggage guidelines to familiarise yourself with the allowed weight, size, and number of bags based on your travel class and destination.
Proceed to the airport
Arrive at the airport with sufficient time before your flight departure. The check-in window may vary but it’s usually available from 48 hours up to 60 minutes before the flight departure time.
Baggage drop counter
Head to the designated baggage drop counter at the airport. These counters are usually separate from the regular check-in counters and are meant for passengers who have checked in online but need to drop off their baggage.
Present your documents
Approach the airline staff at the baggage drop counter and present your travel documents such as your e-ticket and identification like passport, driver’s license, etc.
Check in your baggage
The airline staff will assist you with checking in your baggage. They will weigh your bags to ensure they meet the weight limits and tag them with destination labels.
Collect boarding pass (if needed)
If you haven't already obtained your boarding pass during the online check-in, the staff at the baggage drop counter may issue it to you at this stage.
Can I track my baggage during my journey after it has been checked in?
Yes, we have an advanced tracking system that allows you to monitor the status and location of your checked baggage. Here’s how you can track your baggage:
Baggage tracking system
Access the WorldTracer by visiting the Baggage Tracking Page on our website.
Enter required information
On our tracking page, enter essential details such as your last name, booking reference number (PNR), or baggage reference number (tag number). These details are usually available on your boarding pass or baggage claim tag.
SMS and email updates
Once you check in your baggage, you receive an email and an SMS on your registered number and id respectively. The message will notify that the baggage has been successfully checked in and loaded on the aircraft. This SMS/email includes the baggage reference number (tag number) that will allow you to track your baggage in case it gets misplaced.
Get real-time updates
Once you have provided the required information, the system will display real-time updates on the location and status of your checked baggage. You can track its movement and know when it is delivered at your destination airport.
Baggage tracking provides peace of mind and allows you to trace the whereabouts of your belongings, especially during connecting flights or layovers.
It is advisable to keep your baggage claim tags safe until you receive your luggage at your destination.
Can I check in my baggage the night before my flight?
Although we do not have a specific policy for checking in baggage the night before a flight, in some cases, it can be done depending on the time of your departure. We make exceptions in certain situations, such as early morning flights or if a passenger has a long layover between flights. In such cases, passengers can check in their baggage the night before their flight. In all other cases, passengers must check in their baggage at the airport on the day of their flight within the specified check-in hours.
To ensure a smooth travel experience, ensure that you arrive at the airport well ahead of your flight's departure time and check in your baggage during the designated check-in hours.

Is my checked baggage transferred to the final destination if I have a connecting flight, or do I need to check in again during transit?
For connecting flights, your baggage transfer depends on:
Route: International to domestic or domestic to international travel with a layover at a port.
Type of booking:
Single ticket flight - Flying with Air India or partner airlines throughout the trip
Seperate ticket flight - Flying with different airlines for different segment of your journey.
For detailed information about your baggage transfer depending on your route and booking, see our travel through multiple airports page.
Will my baggage allowance change when I board a connecting flight in a different sector?
Yes, your baggage allowance may change when you board a connecting flight in a different sector, depending on various factors such as airline policy, travel class, and the specific route. Here's what you need to consider:
Same airline and ticket
If your connecting flight is part of the same booking on a single e-ticket with the same airline, the baggage allowance is consistent throughout the journey.
Different airlines, separate tickets
When connecting flights are booked separately or involve different airlines, baggage allowance may vary between sectors. Each airline typically follows baggage policies specific to them, and you may need to comply with the rules of each carrier for the respective segments.
Additional information
To ensure you are aware of any changes in baggage allowance, carefully review the baggage policies of all airlines involved in your journey, especially when booking connecting flights on separate tickets or with different carriers.
Booking your entire itinerary or a single ticket with the same airline or partner airlines can help maintain a consistent baggage allowance for all sectors.
What is the baggage allowance for unaccompanied minors and children?
We take extra care of our young guests. They are allowed to check in the same amount of baggage as any adult passenger on that flight.
Is there any baggage allowance for infants travelling without a seat?
We have a fixed baggage allowance of 10kg/22lb for infants across all travel classes.
What is the fee for booking excess baggage on a flight?
The cost of booking excess baggage on a flight with Air India can vary between several factors, including the route, travel class, and the weight of the additional baggage.
The charges are usually calculated based on the additional weight of the baggage. Air India often uses a tiered pricing structure for excess baggage, where the charges increase with the weight of the additional baggage. The charges vary for domestic and international flights.
Domestic flights
Excess baggage charges can range from approximately INR 400 to INR 750 per kg.
International flights
Excess baggage charges can vary from approximately USD 100 to USD 200 per piece or kg of excess baggage, depending on the route and travel class.
How to calculate excess baggage charges
To determine the exact cost of booking excess baggage on your flight, refer to our official Excess Baggage Page. On this page, you will find detailed information about the charges, guidelines, and the process to pre-book excess baggage if required.
Pre-booking excess baggage is often more cost-effective than paying at the airport. To avoid any surprises and to plan your journey efficiently, reviewing the excess baggage charges for your itinerary is essential.
Travel with ease and ensure your baggage complies with the allowed limits for a smooth journey with us.
Can I pre-book excess baggage before my flight?
Yes, you can pre-book excess baggage on our domestic flights at discounted rates up to 2 hours before departure. In case you are travelling with overweight baggage, the pre-purchase window is up to 6 hours before your flight's departure.

You can also book excess baggage through the following channels:
Air India's city booking offices
Airport offices
Air India call centres
Authorised Air India agents
Can I pay for excess baggage at the airport if I have not prebooked it?
